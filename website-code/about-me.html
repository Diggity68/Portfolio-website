   <h2>Get to know me</h2>
    <p>I’m Phillip Harden and a student currently at Clovis West and CART. Right now, I live in Fresno. I study different programing languages in CART and on my free time and get advice from other experienced coders. I’m already knowledgeable in HTML and CSS while learning JavaScript and Python 2.7. I inspire to work in the game designing industry and design. When you’re down reading about me, feel free to message me by email or visit my LinkedIn page.
</p>

   <p>When my dad first showed me a game called Halo 2, I found myself mesmerized. The game was fun and I enjoyed every minute I was able to play it. It was when Halo 3 came out when I started to be inspired as the story captivated the 7-year-old me. There was this mode known as Forge that let you make not only maps but game modes as well. To me, it opened a door of creativity as I explored the hundreds of games and maps others had made on the community. I wanted to be a part of that. I felt satisfied whenever people had fun and were laughing with others while playing the games I made. I felt accomplished and I wanted to do more, which led me to want to become a game designer. But it was at that point when I felt I had hit a wall. I didn’t know how to continue on with my dream and aspiration. The things I needed to know and the program languages I found I had to learn made no sense to me. It wasn’t until I went to CART when I finally understood what I needed to do and how.
